# RuLexNorm: A Lexical Normalization Dataset for Russian Social Media Text 


**RuLexNorm** — the first open dataset for lexical normalization of Russian-language social media texts.

**Disclaimer:** This dataset contains real comments with explicit or potentially sensitive content.

## Description

- **Dataset** 

The `data/RuLexNorm.norm` file contains the core dataset of over 6,000 Russian text pairs from Twitter (recently X), mapping informal utterances to their normalized equivalents.
- **Model** 

The provided baseline model for lexical normalization is implemented in PyTorch using the Hugging Face transformers library. It is based on a fine-tuned version of the Qwen2.5-3B model, adapted for Russian.

The model is saved in the `LexNorm/model/` directory.

## Data Format

The corpus is organized into entries separated by blank lines. Each entry consists of one or more lines representing a single text pair.

Each line within an entry follows this structure:
*   **Original token** `[TAB]` **Normalized form**

The normalization can be of three types:
1.  **One-to-One (1-1):** A single token is normalized to a single word.
   ```
   Прив! \t Привет!
   ```
2.  **One-to-Many (1-N):** A single token is normalized to multiple words, separated by a space.
   ```
   Чд? \t Что делаешь?
   ```
3.  **Many-to-One (N-1):** Multiple consecutive tokens are merged into a single normalized form. The normalization is provided for the first token, and subsequent tokens in the sequence have an empty string as their normalized form.
   ```
   Чуть \t Чуть-чуть
   чуть \t
   ```
